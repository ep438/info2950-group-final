# Team Agreement

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts are normal and to be expected. It's best to develop a plan for handling conflicts before they arise.

**This agreement is a *living* document.** If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

## Team name

Toto

## To what goals do we all commit?

TODO: We commit to working together, delegating tasks, being respectful, making this a safe, inclusive space, and work hard to reach team goals.

## Weekly meetings

TODO: Wednesdays from 3-4pm, and another hour possibly sometime over the weekend if necessary.

## Meeting "location"

TODO: Duffield.

## Primary method of communication

TODO: Text group chat.

## How should someone notify the others if they cannot attend a lab or scheduled team meeting?

TODO: Text ahead of time in the group chat.

## By when should everyone have their portion of the lab completed?

TODO: Before our weekly meetings.

## How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable?

What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

TODO: We first give a gentle reminder to team members who are not contributing as they should, but if it happens more than once, we will hold a team meeting to discuss roles and task delegations.

## What else do we want to include in this agreement?

Maybe your team needs a *fun* clause...

**Tip:** Not everything in life is about work. Sometimes it is important to celebrate too. Consider grabbing a coffee or ice cream at the completion of your project to celebrate!

TODO: When we complete our project, we will go to Collegetown for dinner to celebrate!

## Using your agreement

You are expected to follow your team agreement. **If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the agreement.** If the agreement isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your conflict using the agreement, please email the instructor at \<info2950\@cornell.edu\>. Please be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the agreement?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your agreement to resolve the issue?" You should attempt to resolve your conflicts on your own first before an instructor will intervene.
